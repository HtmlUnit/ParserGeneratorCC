# Differences to JavaCC

The overall goal is to maintain compatibility to JavaCC but
* The JavaCC code itself should be better maintainable
* The JavaCC code itself should conform to best-practises
* Because this is NOT JavaCC the class names are similar, but the base package name changed from `net.javacc` to `com.helger.pgcc`
